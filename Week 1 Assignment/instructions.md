Welcome to the first assignment of Summer Analytics 2025. This weekâ€™s practice
assignment series will consist of an Assignment and a graded Quiz on Data Analysis.

Good luck and enjoy the course!
Best regards,
Team C&A.
- To begin with, please download the ipynb (which contains the assignment) file and
the dataset (Cars.csv file) to the default directory of your Jupyter Notebook.

- Once copied to the default directory, you can browse the files. When you first open
Jupyter, click on the assignment notebook, which will be visible in the file search
window. You may begin solving the assignment by importing libraries and the
dataset into the notebook.

- The assignment requires the knowledge of Python, Pandas, Numpy and introductory
Data Analysis Skills.

- Specific questions may require searching the web for additional Python/ Pandas
concepts which may not be part of Summer Analytics 2025. It is essential that you
study it independently as this forms a vital part of the learning process.

- You have to submit link to your GitHub Repo which contains the Jupyter Notebook of
your solution.

- The form link for the graded quiz will be shared on the #Announcements Channel
and the website. Make sure you submit the quiz before the given timeline.

- Please follow the honor code. Violation of the same will lead to drastic actions being
taken. We expect you to do the assignment and the quiz on your own as it will
develop your learning process more efficiently.
